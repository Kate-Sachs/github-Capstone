    "## 1.2 Analyzing the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, it is an unpleasant situation to find a rental apartment in NY in comparison \n",
    "with another metropolitan city in the world. In detail, the apartment should fulfil some characteristics in order to be desirable for a potential renter. This characteristics can be the distance from a metro station, close to downtown, number of bedrooms, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Target group of this analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge to resolve is being able to find a rental apartment unit in Manhattan NY that offers similar \n",
    "characteristics. Therefore, in order to set a basis for comparison, I would like to compare rental units that belong to the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apartment with min 2 bedrooms with monthly rent not to exceed US$7000/month\n",
    "Unit located within walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway metro station in Manhattan\n",
    "Area with ammenities and venues similar to the ones described for current location \n",
    "This is a relevant project for a person or entity considering moving to a major city in Europe, US or Asia, since the approach and methodologies used here are applicable in all cases. The use of FourSquare data and mapping techniques combined with data analysis will help resolve the key questions arisen.\n",

    "In order to make a good choice of a similar apartment in Manhattan NY, the following data is required: List/Information on neighborhoods form Manhattan with their Geodata ( latitud and longitud. List/Information about the subway metro stations in Manhattan with geodata. Listed apartments for rent in Manhattan area with descriptions ( how many beds, price, location, address) Venues and ammenities in the Manhattan neighborhoods (e.g. top 10). Manipulation The list of Manhattan neighborhoods is worked out during LAb exercise during the course. A csv file was created which will be read in order to create a dataframe and its mapping. The csv file 'mh_neigh_data.csv' has the following below data structure. The file will be directly read to the Jupiter Notebook for convenience and space savings. The clustering of neighborhoods and mapping will be shown however. An algorythm was used to determine the geodata from Nominatim.\n",

    "A list of places for rent was collected by web-browsing real estate companies in Manhattan : http://www.rentmanhattan.com/index.cfm?page=search&state=results https://www.nestpick.com/search?city=new-york&page=1&order=relevance&district=manhattan&gclid=CjwKCAiAjNjgBRAgEiwAGLlf2hkP3A-cPxjZYkURqQEswQK2jKQEpv_MvKcrIhRWRzNkc_r-fGi0lxoCA7cQAvD_BwE&type=apartment&display=list https://www.realtor.com/apartments/Manhattan_NY A csv file was compiled with the rental place that indicated: areas of Manhattan, address, number of beds, area and monthly rental price. The csv file \"nnnn.csv\" had the following below structure. An algorythm was used to create all the geodata using Nominatim, as shown in section 3.0. The actual algorythm coding may be shown in 'markdown' mode becasues it takes time to run. With the use of geolocator = Nominatim(), it was possible to determine the latitude and longiude for the subway metro locations as well as for the geodata for each rental place listed. The loop algorythms used are shown in the execution of data in section 3.0 \"Great_circle\" function from geolocator was used to calculate distances between two points , as in the case to calculate average rent price for units around each subway station and at 1.6 km radius. Foursquare is used to find the avenues at Manhattan neighborhoods in general and a cluster is created to later be able to search for the venues depending of the location shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Data sources and data manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be used as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "i) Use Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all Manhattan neighborhoods and clustered in groups using foursquare and geopy data to map the location of subway metro stations, separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to be able to identify the venues and ammenities near each metro station, or explore each subway location separately \n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Use Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of rental places, in some form, linked to the subway locations. create a map that depicts, for instance, the average rental price per square ft, around a radious of 1.0 mile (1.6 km) around each subway station - or a similar metrics. Addresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim. Data will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc.\n",

    "The strategy is based on mapping the above described data in section 2.0, in order to facilitate the choice of at least two candidate places for rent. The choice is made based on the demands imposed : location near a subway, rental price and similar venues to Singapore. This visual approach and maps with popups labels allow quick identification of location, price and feature, thus making the selection very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procesing of these DATA and its mapping will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "what is the cost of available rental places that meet the demands?\n",
    "what is the cost of rent around a mile radius from each subway metro station?\n",
    "what is the area of Manhattan with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?\n",
    "What is the distance from work place ( Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future rental home?\n",
    "What are the venues of the two best places to live? How the prices compare?\n",
    "How venues distribute among Manhattan neighborhoods and around metro stations?\n",
    "Are there tradeoffs between size and price and location?\n",
